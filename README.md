# LinearAlgebra

Instructor : Prof. Sharad Sane

This is a project on numerical linear algebra in which we read and understood a paper on 
matrix based ranking method with application to tennis. We wrote python codes and did some demo
using our own random example too.

The python codes and the pdf files for the presentation and report have been uploaded
and can be referred to for a better understanding.
